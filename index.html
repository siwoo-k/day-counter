        Dear Stephanie,<br>
        It’s been a thousand days since we’ve officially became boyfriend and girlfriend!<br>
        I am so proud of us of where we are now as individuals and proud of our growth together as a couple. Every day I spend time with you, I get reminded that I wouldn’t have been able to navigate through many of the struggles and challenges in my life as well as I can do now. Every day I’m with you, I’m swarmed with warm feelings of happiness that can lift me even from my lowest point. The conversations we have gives me so much dopamine and makes me want you, and makes me want to rely on you every second. And your hugs and kisses give me so much comfort and a sense of security that I could never find anywhere and in anyone else.<br><br>
        For the past thousand days, I felt happy and learned to know real love, and found someone who loves me unconditionally. I would make jokes, sometimes that were immature, to make you laugh because I loved watching you smile. I made love to you and you always made sure that I felt secure in my own body, which nobody has ever done before. I made you sad and discouraged sometimes. I would make mistakes and sometimes hurt you when I don’t really mean to. <strong>But</strong>, I would never do anything to lose your trust and your feelings for me. I will never stop loving you and I want to spend every moment, whether good or bad, with you, my girlfriend and my future wife.<br><br>
        Know that (I will always tell you this over and over again) I love you Stephanie Le, and I loved spending a thousand days and I can’t wait to spend another thousand, and another more (and another more ♡). I truly am thankful that you came into my life on the night of October 5th, 2021. Thank you for always being there for me and showing me genuine love these past two years.<br><br>
